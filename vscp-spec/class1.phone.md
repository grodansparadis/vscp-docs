    CLASS1.PHONE

## Description

This class is for phone related functionality. 

##   Type0 (0x00) Undefined. ===== 

General event. 

##   Type1 (0x00) Incoming call. ===== 

There is an incoming phone call. Usually a caller ID node just sends out numerical information. A database event can follow (later) that contains the real text information.

Phone calls are reported in the following form

    from,to

where from is the originating number and to is the receiving phone. Numbers is preferable presented in an international form. So a call from England to a Swedish phone should take the following form

    44-123-1122334,46-657-413430

which is sent in tree frames. Some device can't separate country and area-code and therefore the form

    441231122334,46657413430

will also be valid.

a database connected application can later resolve this and present

    A customer,Eurosource

This is the type=8 event, database info, (see below). Note that the comma cant be used in the descriptive names.
