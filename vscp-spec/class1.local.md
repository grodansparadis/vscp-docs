# Class=511 (0x1FF) Local use

    CLASS1.LOCAL

## Description

This event type is for local defined events. It is thus possible to add user defined events here. In a public environment the risk for collisions with other devices that also use CLASS.LOCAL should be noted. It is good to make user events configurable in the device to give users a chance to avoid problems.
