  CLASS2.MEASUREMENT_STR

===== Description ======

This is a mirror of [[http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=class1.measurement|CLASS1_MEASUREMENT]] where the data is in string form. The zero terminated string has the following form “sensor-index, value-unit, zone, subzone, value” where the value is a floating point value in string form and the senor-index and value-unit is the same as for [[http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=class1.measurement|CLASS1_MEASUREMENT]] but where sensor index's can be in the range 0-255 and value-unit in the range 0-255 (3 is standard).

Floating point numbers should be written as "2345.456" **NOT** as "2345,456" independent of locale and the maximum number can have 483 digits including a possible decimal point.
