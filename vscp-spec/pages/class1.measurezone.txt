====== Class=65 (0x41) Measurement with zone ======

  CLASS1.MEASUREZONE


Measurements with zone information. This class mirrors the standard measurement events is [[http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=class1.measurement|CLASS1.MEASUREMENT=10]] with the difference that index, zone, and sub-zone is added. This in turn limits the data-coding options to normalized integer (see [[http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=data_coding|Data-coding]] for a description). The default unit for the measurement should always be used.
