===== Type = 9 (0x09) Node Heartbeat =====

Heartbeats can be used to indicate that a unit is alive or to send periodic data. This can be sent out at predefined intervals to indicate that the node is alive, however, it does not necessarily mean the node is functioning as it should. It simply states that the node is connected to the network. To check if a node is functioning, other properties such as a measurement event or registry should be used. This event should be sent as a response to a “Segment Status Heartbeat” (CLASS1.PROTOCOL, Type=1) in order to provide a method of finding out what is connected to the network. The data bytes from byte 3 and forward can be used to send a descriptive/user friendly name if desired.

**Mandatory.** All nodes should send this event at least once each minute. A Level II node should normally not send this event but instead send [[http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=class2.information#type_2_0x0002_level_ii_node_heartbeat|Level II node heartbeat]]. Recommended interval is 30-60 seconds but in a node that need to sleep longer to save resources a longer interval can be used.

===== Type = 52 (0x34) Civil sunrise twilight time =====

Civil twilight is the period when the Sun is below the horizon but its center is less than 6 degrees below. The "Civil Twilight Starts" time is the dawn or civil dawn, with the center of the Sun at exactly 6 degrees below the horizon. Equally, the "Civil Twilight Ends" time is dusk or civil dusk, when the Sun is 6 degrees below the horizon in the evening.

During civil twilight, the sky is still illuminated, and with clear weather it is brightest in the direction of the Sun. The Moon and the brightest stars and planets may be visible. It is usually bright enough for outdoor activities without additional lighting.

Near the equator, where the Sun sets and rises in an almost vertical direction, the civil twilight period can last only 21 minutes, a very fast nightfall compared to the much longer periods at southern and northern latitudes. In regions north of 60°24' N or south of 60°24' S, there will be at least one night when it does not get darker than this.

Technically, the start and end times are when the true geocentric position of the Sun is 96 degrees from the zenith position.

A node indicates that sunrise twilight time is detected/calculated.

===== Type = 53 (0x35) Civil sunset twilight time =====

A node indicates that sunset twilight time is detected/calculated.

Civil twilight is the period when the Sun is below the horizon but its center is less than 6 degrees below.

Equally, the "Civil Twilight Ends" time is dusk or civil dusk, when the Sun is 6 degrees below the horizon in the evening.

During civil twilight, the sky is still illuminated, and with clear weather it is brightest in the direction of the Sun. The Moon and the brightest stars and planets may be visible. It is usually bright enough for outdoor activities without additional lighting.

===== Type = 54 (0x36) Nautical sunrise twilight time =====

A node indicates that nautical sunrise twilight time is detected/calculated. 

Nautical twilight is the period when the center of the Sun is between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon, when bright stars are still visible in clear weather and the horizon is becoming visible. It is too dark to do outdoor activities without additional lighting.

In the morning, nautical twilight starts at nautical dawn, when the Sun rises above 12 degrees below the horizon; it ends when the Sun's center reaches 6 degrees below the horizon. In the evening, nautical twilight begins when the Sun sinks below 6 degrees; it ends at nautical dusk, when the Sun is lower than 12 degrees below the horizon.

For locations north of 54°34' N or south of 54°34' S latitude, the Sun will never be lower than 12 degrees below the horizon for a period in the summer.

Technically, the start and end times are when the true geocentric position of the Sun is 102 degrees from the zenith position.

===== Type = 55 (0x37) Nautical sunset twilight time =====

A node indicates that nautical sunset twilight time is detected/calculated.

Nautical twilight is the period when the center of the Sun is between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon, when bright stars are still visible in clear weather and the horizon is becoming visible. It is too dark to do outdoor activities without additional lighting.

In the morning, nautical twilight starts at nautical dawn, when the Sun rises above 12 degrees below the horizon; it ends when the Sun's center reaches 6 degrees below the horizon. In the evening, nautical twilight begins when the Sun sinks below 6 degrees; it ends at nautical dusk, when the Sun is lower than 12 degrees below the horizon.

For locations north of 54°34' N or south of 54°34' S latitude, the Sun will never be lower than 12 degrees below the horizon for a period in the summer.

Technically, the start and end times are when the true geocentric position of the Sun is 102 degrees from the zenith position.

===== Type = 56 (0x38) Astronomical sunrise twilight time =====

A node indicates that astronomical sunrise twilight time is detected/calculated. 

Astronomical twilight is the period when the center of the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon. It starts at astronomical dawn, early in the morning when the Sun is higher than 18 degrees below the horizon. From this point, it will be difficult to observe certain faint stars, galaxies, and other objects because the Sun starts to illuminate the sky. Astronomical twilight ends at astronomical dusk in the late evening, when those faint objects again can be visible because the Sun is lower than 18 degrees below the horizon. In locations north of 48°24' N or south of 48°24', it never gets darker than this near the middle of the summer solstice (June or December).

Technically, the start and end times are when the true geocentric position of the Sun is 108 degrees from the zenith position, or directly above the observer.

Astronomical twilight is the period when the center of the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon.
